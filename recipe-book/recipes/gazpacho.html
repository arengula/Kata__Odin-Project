		<h1> Ingredients </h1>
		<p> All that you'll need is right here! </p>
		<ul> 
			<li> Marinated cherry tomatoes</li>
			<li> Avocado</li>
			<li> Tart cherries</li>
			<li> Diced Nectarine</li>
			<li> Strawberries</li>
			<li> Red onion</li>
			<li> Cilantro</li>
			<li> Raw red bell pepper</li>
			<li> Cucumber</li>
			<li> Raw onions</li>
			<li> Croutons</li>
			<li> Hard boiled eggs</li>
		</ul>

		<h1> Steps </h1>
		<p> Follow these steps and you'll finish no problem! </p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Start by roughly chopping the vegetables to add to the blender. Depending on 
				how powerful your blender is, you may need to chop smaller.
			</li>
			<li>
				Now, add all of the vegetables to the blender. We’ll blend these first — then 
				add the liquids and seasoning! <strong>Tip</strong>: Always put the most liquidy 
				veggies (the tomatoes here) on the bottom of the blender.
			</li>
			<li>
				Blend away!
			</li>
			<li>
				Now we season the gazpacho — add some salt and vinegar first. Then, while the blender 
				is running, slowly incorporate the olive oil so that it blends right in. Finally, 
				check the taste and texture and add some ice-cold water if you want.
			</li>
			<li>
				Your gazpacho is ready to serve! You can enjoy it by the glass, or serve it in a bowl 
				with toppings on the side. Don’t forget a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle
				of sea salt right before eating!
			</li>
		</ol>
